# Rust Implementations of Algorithms from "Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge"

This repository contains Rust implementations of various algorithms and concepts from the book "Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge" by Justin Thaler. The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of cryptographic primitives, protocols, and zero-knowledge proofs while learning Rust programming.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple Cargo projects, each corresponding to a specific algorithm or concept from the book. Each Cargo project is stored in its own folder, and the folders are named according to the relevant chapters or sections of the book.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can find instructions on how to install Rust and Cargo by visiting the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust and Cargo are installed, you can navigate to the folder of a specific Cargo project and run the following command to build and run the project:

```cargo run```
